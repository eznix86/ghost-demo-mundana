Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><p>Next up: <a href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//organising-content/">Organising your content</a> </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Voting is Democracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags which can be used to configure your site structure using dynamic routing.]]></description><link>https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//organising-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce6711491af9c0f20c22786</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sal]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 19:19:39 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520881363902-a0ff4e722963?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520881363902-a0ff4e722963?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Voting is Democracy"><p>Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called<strong> tags</strong> which can be used to configure your site structure using <strong>dynamic routing</strong>. </p><h1 id="basic-tagging">Basic Tagging</h1><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with  News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/weather/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Weather</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h1 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h1><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h1 id="private-tags">Private tags</h1><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/">theme documentation</a>.</em></blockquote><h1 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic Routing</h1><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>For example, you may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> . </p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/routing/">documentation</a> for further details.</em></blockquote><p>You can further customise your site using <a href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//apps-integrations/">Apps &amp; Integrations</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apps & integrations]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.]]></description><link>https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//apps-integrations/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce6711491af9c0f20c22785</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 19:19:38 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" alt="Apps & integrations"><p>There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.</p><h1 id="zapier">Zapier</h1><p>You can connect your Ghost site to over 1,000 external services using the official integration with <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p><p>Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.</p><blockquote><strong>Example</strong>: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).</blockquote><p><strong>Here are the most popular Ghost&lt;&gt;Zapier automation templates:</strong> </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><script src="https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8"></script>

In that case, you could use the new full-bleed image size which stretches right out to the edges of the screen:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.25.0/images/koenig-demo-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ghost editor - affectionately known as Koenig."><figcaption>It's wide</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Or maybe you're looking for something in between, which will give you just a little more size to break up the vertical rhythm of the post without dominating the entire screen. If that's the case, you might like the breakout size:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.25.0/images/koenig-demo-3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ghost editor - affectionately known as Koenig."><figcaption>It's wider, but not widest</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Each of these sizes can be selected from within the editor, and each will output a number of HTML classes for the theme to do styling with. </p><p>Chances are your theme will need a few small updates to take advantage of the new editor functionality. Some people might also find they need to tweak their theme layout, as the editor canvas previously output a wrapper div around its content – but no longer does. If you rely on that div for styling, you can always add it back again in your theme.</p><p>Oh, we have some nice new image captions, too :)</p><h1 id="what-else">What else?</h1><p>Well, you can still write Markdown, as mentioned. In fact you'll find the entire previous Ghost editor <em>inside</em> this editor. If you want to use it then just go ahead and add a Markdown card and start writing like nothing changed at all:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Markdown content works just the way it always did, <strong>simply</strong> and <em>beautifully</em>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>of course you can embed code blocks</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>.new-editor {
	display: bock;
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>or embed things from external services like YouTube...</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfeQTuGyiqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>and yeah you can do full HTML if you need to, as well!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="background:#fafafa;margin-bottom:1.5em;padding:20px 50px;">
    <blink>hello world</blink>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So everything works, hopefully, just about how you would expect. It's like the old editor, but faster, cleaner, prettier, and a whole lot more powerful.</p><h1 id="what-do-i-do-with-this-information">What do I do with this information?</h1><p>Preview this post on your site to see if it causes any issues with your theme. Click on the settings cog in the top right 👉🏼 corner of the editor, then click on '<strong>Preview</strong>' next to the 'Post URL' input.</p><p>If everything looks good to you then there's nothing you need to do, you're all set! If you spot any issues with your design, or there are some funky display issues, then you might need to make some updates to your theme based on the new editor classes being output.</p><p>Head over to the <a href="https://forum.ghost.org/t/ghost-2-0-theme-compatibility-help-support/2103">Ghost 2.0 Theme Compatibility</a> forum topic to discuss any changes and get help if needed.</p><p>That's it!</p><p>We're looking forward to sharing more about the new editor soon</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
