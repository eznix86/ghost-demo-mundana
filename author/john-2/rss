This is the first one!</p><p><strong>A few things you should know upfront</strong>:</p><ol><li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. </li><li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. </li><li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the <a href="https://ghost.org/downloads/">Ghost Desktop App</a> for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device. </li></ol><p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.</p><p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost">community</a>.</p><h2 id="next-up-the-editor">Next up, the editor</h2><p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>. This is where the good stuff happens.</p><blockquote><em>By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default <strong>Ghost</strong> user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts! </em></blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Voting is Democracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags which can be used to configure your site structure using dynamic routing.]]></description><link>https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//organising-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce6711491af9c0f20c22786</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sal]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 19:19:39 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520881363902-a0ff4e722963?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520881363902-a0ff4e722963?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Voting is Democracy"><p>Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called<strong> tags</strong> which can be used to configure your site structure using <strong>dynamic routing</strong>. </p><h1 id="basic-tagging">Basic Tagging</h1><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with  News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/weather/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Weather</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h1 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h1><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h1 id="private-tags">Private tags</h1><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/">theme documentation</a>.</em></blockquote><h1 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic Routing</h1><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>For example, you may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> . </p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/routing/">documentation</a> for further details.</em></blockquote><p>You can further customise your site using <a href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//apps-integrations/">Apps &amp; Integrations</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost editor - affectionately known as Koenig.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hey there!

<p>If you've gotten pretty comfortable with <a href="https://wowthemesnet.github.io/ghost-demo-mundana//the-editor/">all the basics</a> of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>
<p>As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.</p>
<h2 id="specialformatting">Special formatting</h2>
<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>strike through</s></li>
<li><mark>highlight</mark></li>
<li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writingcodeblocks">Writing code blocks</h2>
<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>
<pre><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fullbleedimages">Full bleed images</h2>
<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full" alt="Yet Another Post Layout Style"></p>
<p>which is styled with...</p>
<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {
    max-width: 100vw;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>
<h2 id="referencelists">Reference lists</h2>
<p><strong>The quick brown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Wikipedia: Fox">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Wikipedia: Dog">dog</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>
<h2 id="creatingfootnotes">Creating footnotes</h2>
<p>The quick brown fox<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>
<h2 id="fullhtml">Full HTML</h2>
<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<hr class="footnotes-sep">
<section class="footnotes">
<ol class="footnotes-list">
<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Foxes are red <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Dogs are usually not red <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:</p>
<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.<br>
Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.</p>

<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png" alt="Wit and Wisdom of Don Quixote"></p>
<p>Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it. While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep the site off the radar.</p>
<p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for very basic privacy.</p>

<p>Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes. However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs. Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.</p>
<p>There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org">Ghost Theme Marketplace</a>, or you can simply create your own from scratch.</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org"><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/marketplace.jpg" alt="With Lord Byron at the Sandwich Islands"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like <code>{{author.name}}</code>, for example, outputs the name of the current author.</p>
<p>The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper">the source code for Casper</a>, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>default.hbs</code> is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.</li>
<li><code>post.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing a post.</li>
<li><code>index.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>We've got <a href="http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about">full and extensive theme documentation</a> which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.</p>
<p>If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a <strong>#themes</strong> channel in our <a href="https://slack.ghost.org">public Slack community</a> which we always recommend joining!</p>

Most of the &quot;brethren&quot; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.</p>
<p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.</p>
<p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>
<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>
<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>
<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>
<p>If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, &quot;brethren!&quot; Be careful, teachers!</p>

<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>
<p>In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the &quot;unalienable Rights&quot; of &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked &quot;insufficient funds.&quot;</p>
<p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p>
<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.</p>
<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p>
<p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p>
<p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.</p>
<p>We cannot walk alone.</p>
<p>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.</p>
<p>We cannot turn back.</p>
<p>There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, &quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: &quot;For Whites Only.&quot; We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until &quot;justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.</p>
<p>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.</p>
<p>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>
<p>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of &quot;interposition&quot; and &quot;nullification&quot; -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; &quot;and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.&quot;</p>
<p>This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.</p>
<p>With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</p>
<p>And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.<br>
Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,<br>
From every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p>
<p>And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.<br>
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.<br>
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.<br>
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not only that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.<br>
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.<br>
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.<br>
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:</p>
<p><em>Free at last! Free at last!</em></p>
<p><em>Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em></p>
